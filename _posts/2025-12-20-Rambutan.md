## Overview
A really nice spot in the heart of Borough market with a dimly lit atmosphere, open kitchen and great counter seats. The food is full of flavour, with a small menu that includes some really interesting dishes. Must tries include the Chicken Pongal and the rotis. It does get busy, so book ahead or be ready to queue at peak times.
